# PRODUCTIVITY AID APP

## Specification
This app is a HTML/CSS/JS frontends that access data from a public API. 
Here is the link to the public API - https://www.boredapi.com. All interactions 
between the client and the API are handled asynchronously and use JSON as the 
communication format. There are at least three event listeners used to enable 
interactivity in the app. Each of the event listener has its own unique callback function.  
This app also implements at least one instance of array iteration using array methods. 


## Structuring My Code
There are three files:
* An `index.html`  file, which contains the basic text of the app. 
* An `functionality.js` file, that contains the codes that drives the app's functionality.
* An `design.css` file that contains the aesthetics codes.


## Deliverables
* As a user, I should be able to type an activity into the input field.
* As a user, I should be able to click some form of a submit button.
* As a user, I expect to see the activity provided appear I click the submit button.
* As a user, when I run out of ideas on activities to do, I should be able to click a button 
asking for activity suggestions.
* As a user, I should be able to put a time-track on the amount of time spent on an activity.
* As a user, I should be able to pause and resume this time-tracker. 
* As a user, I expect to make a comment or note below an activity.
* As a user, I should be able to delete an activity after completion. 


## Conclusion

That's it! I hope you enjoy my Productivity Aid App!
