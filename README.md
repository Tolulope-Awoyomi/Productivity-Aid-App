# PRODUCTIVITY AID APP

## Specification
This is a one-page HTML/CSS/JS front-end web app that accesses data from a public API. 
Here is the link to the public API - https://www.boredapi.com. All interactions 
between the client and the API are handled asynchronously and uses JSON as the 
communication format. There are at least three event listeners used to enable 
interactivity in the app. They are DOMContentLoaded, click, and mouseover events. 
Each of the event listener has its own unique callback function.  
This app also implements at least one instance of array iteration using the forEach array method. 


## Structuring My Code
There are three files:
* An `index.html` file: contains the basic text of the app. 
* An `functionality.js` file: contains the codes that drive the app's functionality.
* An `design.css` file: contains the codes used to achieve the aesthetics of the web app.


## Deliverables
* As a user, I should be able to type an activity into the input field.
* As a user, I should be able to click some form of a submit button.
* As a user, I expect to see the activity provided appear after I click the submit button.
* As a user, I should be able to click a "start timer" button to track the amount of time spent on an activity.
* As a user, I should be able to pause and resume this timer. 
* As a user, I should be able to manually increase and decrease the time shown on the timer. 
* As a user, I should be able to input a note and click on a submit button.
* As a user, I expect to see my note appear after I click the submit button.
* As a user, I should be able to delete an activity after completion. 
* As a user, when I run out of ideas on activities to do, I should be able to click a button for activity suggestions.
* As a user, I should be able to delete an activity suggestion that I am not interested in.
